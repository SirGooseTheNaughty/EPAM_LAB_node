# Homeworks for EPAM node.js learning.

## HW1:
* **listeningServer.js** - server, getting the requests;
* **pingingServer.js** - server, sending GET and POST requests.

## HW2:
* **serverHW2.js** - saying "hello" to all users who provide the necessary header. All pairs name+id are saved in json file.

## HW3:
* **serverHW3.js** - express.js server. Middlewares: 1) it should be a POST request; 2) it should contain a specific header; 3) you should introduce yourself. Then server will greet you, put your name and ip in it's database and suggest you to see all past users on /userlist.

## HW4:
* **serverHW4.js** - similar to HW3 but with MongoDB instead of json file.

## HW5:
* **serverHW5.js** - using passport, strategies and JWT.
